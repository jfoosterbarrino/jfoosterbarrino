### Welcome! âš¡

My name is Jalen and I'm a full-stack web developer and former collegiate athlete with a background in engineering, management, and fitness. I shine in circumstances that require deductive reasoning, attention to detail, and performing under pressure. I relish any opportunity to expand my skillset and take great pride in creating things that people benefit from forever. Being a team player that knows how to lead and how to be led is something I'm always mindful of and striving for.

Software Development skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, ReactJS, Flask, Django, Material UI, Bootstrap,  PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Object-Oriented Programming, REST APIs, Git, GitHub, and Heroku.
